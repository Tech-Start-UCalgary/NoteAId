textVariable = "The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019; a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in surrounding Hubei failed to contain the outbreak, and it quickly spread to other parts of mainland China and around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Multiple variants of the virus have emerged and become dominant in many countries since 2021, with the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants being the most virulent. As of 18 November 2021, more than 255 million cases and 5.12 million deaths have been confirmed, making the pandemic one of the deadliest in history. COVID-19 symptoms range from none to life-threatening. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but the virus can transmit over longer distances, particularly indoors and in poorly ventilated areas. Transmission can also occur, rarely, via contaminated surfaces or fluids. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Several vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns since December 2020. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, hand washing, disinfecting surfaces, and quarantining people who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop medications that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, business closures, workplace hazard controls, testing protocols, and systems for tracing contacts of the infected."
textVariable2 = """The Flames were the result of the NHL's first pre-emptive strike against the upstart World Hockey Association (WHA).[3] In December 1971, the NHL hastily granted a team to Long Island — the New York Islanders — in an attempt to keep the WHA's New York Raiders out of the recently completed Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to the Atlanta-based group that owned the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks, headed by prominent local real estate developer Tom Cousins.[4] Cousins named the team the Flames after the fire resulting from the March to the Sea in the American Civil War by General William Tecumseh Sherman, in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed. They played home games in the Omni Coliseum in downtown Atlanta.[5]  The Flames were relatively successful early on. Under head coaches Bernie Boom Boom Geoffrion, Fred Creighton and Al MacNeil, the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta.[6] In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, won only 31 games during their first two years in the league combined.[7] However, this success did not carry over to the playoffs, as the Flames won only two postseason games during their time in Atlanta.[8]  Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing. Longtime general manager Cliff Fletcher said years later that Cousins' initial financial projections for an NHL team did not account for the WHA entering the picture.[9] The Flames were also a poor draw, and never signed a major television contract.[5]  In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy. With few serious offers from local groups, he was very receptive to an offer from Canadian entrepreneur (and former Oilers owner) Nelson Skalbania. He was fronting a group of Calgary businessmen that included oil magnates Harley Hotchkiss, Ralph T. Scurfield, Norman Green, Doc and Byron Seaman, and former Calgary Stampeders great Norman Kwong.[5] A last-ditch effort to keep the team in Atlanta fell short, and Cousins sold the team to Skalbania for US$16 million, a record sale price for an NHL team at the time.[9] On May 21, 1980, Skalbania announced that the team would move to Calgary.[10] He chose to retain the Flames name, feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like Calgary, while the flaming "A" logo was replaced by a flaming "C".[11] Skalbania sold his interest in 1981, and the Flames have been locally owned since.[12] Early years in Calgary (1980–1985)  Unlike the WHA's Calgary Cowboys, who folded three years earlier, the Flames were immediately embraced by the city of Calgary. While the Cowboys could manage to sell only 2,000 season tickets in their final campaign of 1976–77, the Flames sold 10,000 full- and half-season ticket packages in the 7,000 seat Stampede Corral.[13] Brad Marsh with the Flames during the 1980–81 season. The team found greater playoff success, qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs for their first five years after moving to Calgary.  Led by Kent Nilsson's 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames qualified for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39–27–14 record, good for third in the Patrick Division.[14] The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi-finals.[15] This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in 1981–82, Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster.[9][16] Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that remained together through the early 1990s.  Fletcher's efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including Joel Otto, Gary Suter and Colin Patterson.[17] Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring Hakan Loob and other key players. He was among the first to draft players from the Soviet Union, including CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in 1983, but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989.[18] Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their 1984 Stanley Cup Championship.[19]  In 1983, the Flames moved into their new home, the Olympic Saddledome (now known as the Scotiabank Saddledome). Located on the grounds of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, the Saddledome was built as a venue for the 1988 Winter Olympics. In three seasons in the Corral, the Flames lost only 32 home games.[10] The Saddledome hosted the NHL All-Star Game in 1985, a 6–4 victory by the Wales Conference.[20] Presidents' Trophies and Stanley Cup Finals (1985–1990)  The players acquired by Fletcher matured into one of the strongest teams in the NHL during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one.[21] However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers. The Oilers and Flames usually finished at or near the top of the Campbell Conference and were usually among the best teams in the entire league during this time. However, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the Campbell Conference finals.[9] That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals.[22] From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.[23] By 1986, the Flames landed forwards Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing second in the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points),[14] the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs,[19] setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games, the only time the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series in the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net.[24] The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.[25][26][27]  From there, the Flames went on to the Campbell Conference Finals, where they defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5–2 with ten minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game.[28] Calgary won Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time.[19] The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy. """

textVariable4 = """SCENE II Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.  Enter PORTIA and NERISSA PORTIA      By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of     this great world.  NERISSA      You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in     the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and     yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit     with too much as they that starve with nothing. It     is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the     mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but     competency lives longer.  PORTIA      Good sentences and well pronounced.  NERISSA      They would be better, if well followed.  PORTIA      If to do were as easy as to know what were good to     do, chapels had been churches and poor men's     cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that     follows his own instructions: I can easier teach     twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the     twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may     devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps     o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the     youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the     cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to     choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may     neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I     dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed     by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,     Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?  NERISSA      Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their     death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,     that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,     silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning     chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any     rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what     warmth is there in your affection towards any of     these princely suitors that are already come?  PORTIA      I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest     them, I will describe them; and, according to my     description, level at my affection.  NERISSA      First, there is the Neapolitan prince.  PORTIA      Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but     talk of his horse; and he makes it a great     appropriation to his own good parts, that he can     shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his     mother played false with a smith.  NERISSA      Then there is the County Palatine.  PORTIA      He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you     will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and     smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping     philosopher when he grows old, being so full of     unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be     married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth     than to either of these. God defend me from these     two!  NERISSA      How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?  PORTIA      God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.     In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,     he! why, he hath a horse better than the     Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than     the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a     throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will     fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I     should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me     I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I     shall never requite him.  NERISSA      What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron     of England?  PORTIA      You know I say nothing to him, for he understands     not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,     nor Italian, and you will come into the court and     swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.     He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can     converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!     I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round     hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his     behavior every where.  NERISSA      What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?  PORTIA      That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he     borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and     swore he would pay him again when he was able: I     think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed     under for another.  NERISSA      How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?  PORTIA      Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and     most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when     he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and     when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:     and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall     make shift to go without him.  NERISSA      If he should offer to choose, and choose the right     casket, you should refuse to perform your father's     will, if you should refuse to accept him.  PORTIA      Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a     deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,     for if the devil be within and that temptation     without, I know he will choose it. I will do any     thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.  NERISSA      You need not fear, lady, the having any of these     lords: they have acquainted me with their     determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their     home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless     you may be won by some other sort than your father's     imposition depending on the caskets.  PORTIA      If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as     chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner     of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers     are so reasonable, for there is not one among them     but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant     them a fair departure.  NERISSA      Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a     Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither     in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?  PORTIA      Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.  NERISSA      True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish     eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.  PORTIA      I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of     thy praise.      Enter a Serving-man     How now! what news?  Servant      The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take     their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a     fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the     prince his master will be here to-night.  PORTIA      If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a     heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should     be glad of his approach: if he have the condition     of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had     rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,     Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.     Whiles we shut the gates     upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.      Exeunt """
textVar5 = "2011–2012  After early ""proof-of-concept"" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting 9.9 million in bitcoins, worth about $214 million.[27]: 222   In 2011, the price started at $0.30 per bitcoin, growing to $5.27 for the year. The price rose to $31.50 on 8 June. Within a month, the price fell to $11.00. The next month it fell to $7.80, and in another month to $4.77.[97]  In 2012, bitcoin prices started at $5.27, growing to $13.30 for the year.[97] By 9 January the price had risen to $7.38, but then crashed by 49% to $3.80 over the next 16 days. The price then rose to $16.41 on 17 August, but fell by 57% to $7.10 over the next three days.[98]  The Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin's development and uptake.[99]  On 1 November 2011, the reference implementation Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5.0 was released. It introduced a front end that used the Qt user interface toolkit.[100] The software previously used Berkeley DB for database management. Developers switched to LevelDB in release 0.8 in order to reduce blockchain synchronization time.[citation needed] The update to this release resulted in a minor blockchain fork on 11 March 2013. The fork was resolved shortly afterwards.[citation needed] Seeding nodes through IRC was discontinued in version 0.8.2. From version 0.9.0 the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core. Transaction fees were reduced again by a factor of ten as a means to encourage microtransactions.[citation needed] Although Bitcoin Core does not use OpenSSL for the operation of the network, the software did use OpenSSL for remote procedure calls. Version 0.9.1 was released to remove the network's vulnerability to the Heartbleed bug.[citation needed] 2013–2016  In 2013, prices started at $13.30 rising to $770 by 1 January 2014.[97]  In March 2013 the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with different rules due to a bug in version 0.8 of the bitcoin software. The two blockchains operated simultaneously for six hours, each with its own version of the transaction history from the moment of the split. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software, selecting the backwards-compatible version of the blockchain. As a result, this blockchain became the longest chain and could be accepted by all participants, regardless of their bitcoin software version.[101] During the split, the Mt. Gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the price dropped by 23% to $37[101][102] before recovering to the previous level of approximately $48 in the following hours.[103]  The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for ""decentralized virtual currencies"" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as Money Service Businesses (MSBs), that are subject to registration or other legal obligations.[104][105][106]  In April, exchanges BitInstant and Mt. Gox experienced processing delays due to insufficient capacity[107] resulting in the bitcoin price dropping from $266 to $76 before returning to $160 within six hours.[108] The bitcoin price rose to $259 on 10 April, but then crashed by 83% to $45 over the next three days.[98]  On 15 May 2013, US authorities seized accounts associated with Mt. Gox after discovering it had not registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN in the US.[109][110] On 23 June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration listed ₿11.02 as a seized asset in a United States Department of Justice seizure notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoin.[111] The FBI seized about ₿30,000[112] in October 2013 from the dark web website Silk Road, following the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht.[113][114][115] These bitcoins were sold at blind auction by the United States Marshals Service to venture capital investor Tim Draper.[112] Bitcoin's price rose to $755 on 19 November and crashed by 50% to $378 the same day. On 30 November 2013, the price reached $1,163 before starting a long-term crash, declining by 87% to $152 in January 2015.[98]  On 5 December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoins.[116] After the announcement, the value of bitcoins dropped,[117] and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services.[118] Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009.[119]  In 2014, prices started at $770 and fell to $314 for the year.[97] On 30 July 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation started accepting donations of bitcoin.[120]  In 2015, prices started at $314 and rose to $434 for the year. In 2016, prices rose and climbed up to $998 by 1 January 2017.[97]  Release 0.10 of the software was made public on 16 February 2015. It introduced a consensus library which gave programmers easy access to the rules governing consensus on the network. In version 0.11.2 developers added a new feature which allowed transactions to be made unspendable until a specific time in the future.[121] Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released on 15 April 2016, and enabled multiple soft forks to occur concurrently.[122] Around 100 contributors worked on Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 which was released on 23 August 2016.  In July 2016, the CheckSequenceVerify soft fork activated.[123] In August 2016, the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange platform was hacked in the second-largest breach of a Bitcoin exchange platform up to that time, and 119,756 bitcoin,[124] worth about $72 million at the time, were stolen.[125]  In October 2016, Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release featured the ""Segwit"" soft fork that included a scaling improvement aiming to optimize the bitcoin blocksize.[citation needed] The patch which was originally finalised in April, and 35 developers were engaged to deploy it.[citation needed] This release featured Segregated Witness (SegWit) which aimed to place downward pressure on transaction fees as well as increase the maximum transaction capacity of the network.[126][non-primary source needed] The 0.13.1 release endured extensive testing and research leading to some delays in its release date.[citation needed] SegWit prevents various forms of transaction malleability.[127][non-primary source needed] 2017–2019  Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[128] On 15 July 2017, the controversial Segregated Witness [SegWit] software upgrade was approved (""locked-in""). Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability.[129] SegWit was subsequently activated on the network on 24 August 2017. The bitcoin price rose almost 50'%' in the week following SegWit's approval.[129] On 21 July 2017, bitcoin was trading at $2,748, up 52'%' from 14 July 2017's $1,835.[129] Supporters of large blocks who were dissatisfied with the activation of SegWit forked the software on 1 August 2017 to create Bitcoin Cash, becoming one of many forks of bitcoin such as Bitcoin Gold.[130]  Prices started at $998 in 2017 and rose to $13,412.44 on 1 January 2018,[97] after reaching its all-time high of $19,783.06 on 17 December 2017.[131]  China banned trading in bitcoin, with first steps taken in September 2017, and a complete ban that started on 1 February 2018. Bitcoin prices then fell from $9,052 to $6,914 on 5 February 2018.[98] The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over 90'%' in September 2017 to less than 1'%' in June 2018.[132]  Throughout the rest of the first half of 2018, bitcoin's price fluctuated between $11,480 and $5,848. On 1 July 2018, bitcoin's price was $6,343.[133][134] The price on 1 January 2019 was $3,747, down 72'%' for 2018 and down 81'%' since the all-time high.[133][135]  In September 2018, an anonymous party discovered and reported an invalid-block denial-of-server vulnerability to developers of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited. Further analysis by bitcoin developers showed the issue could also allow the creation of blocks violating the 21 million coin limit and CVE-2018-17144 was assigned and the issue resolved.[136][non-primary source needed]  Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges, including thefts from Coincheck in January 2018, Bithumb in June, and Bancor in July. For the first six months of 2018, $761 million worth of cryptocurrencies was reported stolen from exchanges.[137] Bitcoin's price was affected even though other cryptocurrencies were stolen at Coinrail and Bancor as investors worried about the security of cryptocurrency exchanges.[138][139][140] In September 2019 the Intercontinental Exchange (the owner of the NYSE) began trading of bitcoin futures on its exchange called Bakkt.[141] Bakkt also announced that it would launch options on bitcoin in December 2019.[142] In December 2019, YouTube removed bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos, but later restored the content after judging they had ""made the wrong call.""[143]  In February 2019, Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga Fintech Solutions failed with approximately $200 million missing.[144] By June 2019 the price had recovered to $13,000.[145] 2020–present Bitcoin price  On 13 March 2020, bitcoin fell below $4,000 during a broad market selloff, after trading above $10,000 in February 2020.[146] On 11 March 2020, 281,000 bitcoins were sold, held by owners for only thirty days.[145] This compared to ₿4,131 that had laid dormant for a year or more, indicating that the vast majority of the bitcoin volatility on that day was from recent buyers.
